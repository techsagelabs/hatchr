# Fixes Applied - December 30, 2025

## Issue 1: Video Upload Error ❌ → ✅

### Problem
When attempting to upload video files, users received error:
```
"mime type video/mp4 is not supported"
```

### Root Cause
Supabase Storage bucket `project-assets` was not configured to accept video MIME types. The bucket had either:
- No allowed MIME types configured (defaulting to images only)
- Explicitly restricted MIME types excluding videos

### Solution Applied
1. **Created configuration guide**: `fix-video-upload-supabase.md`
2. **Provided SQL migration**:
   ```sql
   UPDATE storage.buckets 
   SET allowed_mime_types = ARRAY['image/*', 'video/*']
   WHERE id = 'project-assets';
   ```

### Action Required
**You must run the SQL migration** in your Supabase SQL Editor to allow video uploads.

See detailed instructions in: `fix-video-upload-supabase.md`

## Issue 2: Carousel Navigation Not Working on Home Page ❌ → ✅

### Problem
When projects with multiple images displayed on the home page:
- Left/Right navigation arrows didn't work
- Clicking arrows navigated to project detail page instead
- Carousel couldn't be interacted with

### Root Cause
The `ImageCarousel` component was wrapped inside a `<Link>` element in `project-card.tsx`. This caused:
1. All click events to be captured by the Link
2. Link's navigation to override button click handlers
3. Event bubbling prevented carousel interaction

### Solution Applied

#### 1. Restructured Media Section (`components/project-card.tsx`)
**Before:**
```tsx
<Link href={`/projects/${project.id}`}>
  <div>
    <ImageCarousel images={project.images} />
  </div>
</Link>
```

**After:**
```tsx
<div>
  {project.images && project.images.length > 1 ? (
    <div onClick={() => router.push(`/projects/${project.id}`)}>
      <ImageCarousel images={project.images} />
    </div>
  ) : (
    <Link href={`/projects/${project.id}`}>
      {/* Single image/video */}
    </Link>
  )}
</div>
```

**Key Changes:**
- Removed Link wrapper from carousel
- Added `onClick` handler on parent div for background clicks
- Kept Link wrapper only for single image fallback
- Carousel buttons can now handle their own clicks

#### 2. Added Event Propagation Handling (`components/ui/image-carousel.tsx`)
Added `e.stopPropagation()` to all interactive elements:

```tsx
// Navigation Arrows
onClick={(e) => {
  e.stopPropagation()
  prevImage()
}}

// Fullscreen Button
onClick={(e) => {
  e.stopPropagation()
  setIsFullscreen(true)
}}

// Thumbnail Buttons
onClick={(e) => {
  e.stopPropagation()
  goToImage(index)
}}
```

**What This Does:**
- Prevents button clicks from bubbling to parent div
- Parent `onClick` only fires when clicking carousel background
- Allows users to navigate carousel without going to project page

## Testing Instructions

### Test 1: Carousel Navigation on Home Page
1. Navigate to home page
2. Find a project card with multiple images (carousel should be visible)
3. Hover over carousel - left/right arrows should appear
4. Click left arrow - should go to previous image
5. Click right arrow - should go to next image
6. Click carousel background - should navigate to project page
7. Verify clicking arrows does NOT navigate to project page

**Expected Behavior:**
- ✅ Arrows navigate through images
- ✅ Background click goes to project
- ✅ No unexpected navigation

### Test 2: Video Upload
1. Run the SQL migration in Supabase (see `fix-video-upload-supabase.md`)
2. Go to project submission page
3. Click "Click to upload images or videos"
4. Select a video file (MP4, MOV, or WebM, < 50MB)
5. Video should upload successfully
6. Video thumbnail should appear in upload preview
7. Submit project
8. Video should play in carousel on project page

**Expected Behavior:**
- ✅ Video uploads without MIME type error
- ✅ Video preview shows in upload grid
- ✅ Video plays in carousel with controls

---

## User Experience Improvements

### Before
- ❌ Carousel on home page was non-interactive decoration
- ❌ Users couldn't preview multiple images without clicking through
- ❌ Video uploads failed with cryptic error message
- ❌ Entire carousel area acted as a link (poor UX)

### After
- ✅ Carousel is fully interactive on home page
- ✅ Users can browse project images before visiting detail page
- ✅ Video uploads work seamlessly
- ✅ Clear separation: buttons = navigation, background = link
- ✅ Better user control and expectations

## Technical Notes

### Event Propagation Pattern
When you have nested interactive elements (buttons inside clickable divs), you must:
1. Call `e.stopPropagation()` on inner elements
2. This prevents the click from "bubbling" to outer elements
3. Allows each element to handle its own click events

### Link vs onClick Pattern
- **Link**: Use for semantic navigation, SEO, accessibility
- **onClick + router.push()**: Use when you need conditional behavior
- **Rule**: Never wrap complex interactive components in Links

### Supabase Storage MIME Types
- Storage buckets can restrict file types for security
- `allowed_mime_types = NULL` = allow all (less secure)
- `allowed_mime_types = ARRAY['type/*']` = allow specific types
- Always validate file types on both client and server

---

## Rollback Instructions (If Needed)

If you need to revert these changes:

### Carousel Navigation
```bash
git checkout HEAD~1 -- components/project-card.tsx
git checkout HEAD~1 -- components/ui/image-carousel.tsx
```

### Video Upload (Revert Supabase)
```sql
-- Revert to images only
UPDATE storage.buckets 
SET allowed_mime_types = ARRAY['image/*']
WHERE id = 'project-assets';
```
